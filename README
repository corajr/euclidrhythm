euclidrhythm is a(n uncreatively named) Euclidean rhythm generator designed for multitouch surfaces. It is based on the so-called Bjorklund algorithm, a close relative of Euclid's method for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. This algorithm effectively finds the most even distributions of pulses over a given number of discrete steps; when such patterns are played back as audio, they can produce a variety of rhythms that have been used in musics from around the world.

Use with just a mouse is possible, but for full functionality, the program should be used with a TUIO tracker, such as the Kinect-based OpenNI2TUIO on OS X
<http://www.patriciogonzalezvivo.com/blog/?p=289> or one of the many trackers found at <http://www.tuio.org/?software>. TuioPad <http://code.google.com/p/tuiopad/> and TUIOdroid <http://code.google.com/p/tuiodroid/> may be of interest to iOS and Android users.

euclidrhythm uses the following Processing libraries:
* tuioZones <http://jlyst.com/tz/>
* theMidiBus <http://smallbutdigital.com/themidibus.php>
* oscP5 <http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/>

Finally, Windows users may have to install a soundbank if their JRE does not include one: see <http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/sound/soundbanks.html>.
